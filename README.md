## About UI

This UI is mainly designed to be used in small screens such as tablets and phones. It's also adapted for computer screens although it's not its main purpose.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

Run `npm run start:server` for the backend server. The SQL file to restore the database is inside de 'backend' folder.
